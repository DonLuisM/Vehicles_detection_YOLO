<img src="Result/results.png" alt="Model Results" width="800">

## üìñ Project Description
This project implements a vehicle detection and classification system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and OpenCV in Python. It provides an advanced solution for real-time vehicle detection, utilizing modern computer vision techniques.

### üõ†  Technologies Used
- Framework: YOLO (You Only Look Once).
- Computer Vision: OpenCV (cv2).
- Programming Language: Python.
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - tkinter
  - PIL (Python Imaging Library)

### üéØ Key Features
- Real-time vehicle detection.
- Identification of multiple vehicle classes.
- Optimized algorithm for efficient performance.

### üì¶ Installation
**Note**:  
> The YOLO model code was developed in Google Colab. Therefore, this code is useful for the real-time detection part. To use this code, you need to have your YOLO model file (best.pt) and load it into the model_V8n variable.

```
# Steps to install

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DonLuisM/Vehicles_detection_YOLO.git

# Make sure to load the YOLO model (best.pt)
modelo_V8n = YOLO('your_YOLO_model.pt')
```

### ü§ù Contributions
The models require changes in hyperparameters or variations in their epochs. So, contributions are welcome!
