# ðŸš— Vehicles Classification and Detection with YOLO

## Project Overview
Vehicle detection system implemented using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and OpenCV in Python. This project provides an advanced real-time vehicle detection solution using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Framework: YOLO (You Only Look Once).
- Computer Vision: OpenCV (cv2).
- Programming Language: Python.
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, tkinter, PIL.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- Real-time vehicle detection.
- Multiple vehicle class identification.
- Performance optimized algorithm.

### ðŸ“¦ Installation
**Note**:  
> The YOLO model code was made in Colab, so this code is useful in the direct real detection part. To make use of this code, you must have your YOLO file (`best.pt`) and upload it in the `model_V8n` variable.
